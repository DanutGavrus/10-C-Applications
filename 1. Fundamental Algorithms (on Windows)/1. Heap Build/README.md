# Heap Build
This project implements correctly and efficiently two methods for building a heap, namely the bottom-up and the top-down strategies. Also, it implements heapsort.<br/>
When run, a small demo appears and then a .html file is created containing graphs showing the differences between methods by tracking the number of assignments and comparisons each one does.<br/>
Each method receives as input arrays of dimensions between 100 and 10.000 one after the other having an increment of 100 filled with random values.

## Getting Started
You can find a .exe version of the project for EASY TESTING. Also, this project's code can be found in the .cpp file.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION !
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on 1. Heap Build.exe
```
If that does not work, create a new C/C++ project containing the .cpp file and add the .h file as a header, then run it.

### Built With
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - The C/C++ IDE used

### Warning !
You might get a warning because the .exe file was not certificated, but it is a trusted file !!!
