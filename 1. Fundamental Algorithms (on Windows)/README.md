# Programming Techniques and Data Structures implemented:
For these projects the following programming techniques and data structures were implemented correctly and efficiently:
```
-Heap Bottom-Up;
-Heap Top Down;
-QuickSort;
-QuickSelect;
-Bubble Sort;
-Insertion Sort;
-Binary Insertion Sort;
-Selection Sort;
-Order Statistics Tree;
-Binary Search Tree;
-Disjoint Sets
-The Kruskal Algorithm;
-Merge K Lists;
-Hash Tables;
-Depth First Search(DFS);
-Breadth First Search(BFS).
```

## Getting Started
For each project you can find .exe version of it for EASY TESTING. Also, each has his own README and code can be found in the .cpp file.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION ! For each project:
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on "Application Name".exe
```
If that does not work, a new project must be created containing the .cpp file, and add the .h file as a header, then run.

### Warning !
```
! You might get a warning because .exe files were not certificated, but those are trusted files !
```

### Applications Were Built With
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - The C/C++ IDE used
