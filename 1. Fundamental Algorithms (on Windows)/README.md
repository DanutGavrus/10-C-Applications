## Getting Started
For each project you can find BOTH .exe and .jar versions of the project for EASY TESTING. Also, each has his own README and code can be found in the attached folders where .java files are.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION ! For each project:
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on "Application Name".exe
```
If that does not work, open .jar file:
```
Double click on "Application Name".jar
```
If both do not work, a new project must be created containing the folders file the .java files, then run.

### Prerequisites
For each project you need to have at least these installed:
```
-java jre: https://www.java.com/en/download/
-java jdk 11.0.3 or higher: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
```

### Applications Were Built With
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - The Java IDE used

### Warning !
For each project you might get a warning because the .exe files were not certificated, but those are trusted files. For the .jar versions there should be no warning !
