# Disjoint Sets
This project implements correctly and efficiently:
```
-"The base operations for disjoint sets: "Make_Set", "Union", "Find_Set";
-"The Kruskal Algorithm".
```
WHEN RUN, a small demo appears showing the programming technique and data structure used. Then a .html file is created containing graphs showing the differences between methods by tracking the number of assignments and comparisons each one does.<br/>
As input, each method receives arrays of dimensions between 100 and 10.000 one after the other. The increment is 100 and the arrays are filled with random values.

## Graph Used for Demo

## Generated Graphs
YOU SHOULD RUN the .exe file in order to generate the graphs by yourself and to see the demo.<br/>
ALSO, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD the .rar archive containig a .html file with the graphs in order to see them bigger and clearer.

## Getting Started
You can find a .exe version of the project for EASY TESTING. Also, this project's code can be found in the .cpp file.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION !
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on 5. Disjoint Sets.exe
```
If that does not work, create a new C/C++ project containing the .cpp file and add the .h file as a header, then run it.

### Warning !
```
! You might get a warning because the .exe file was not certificated, but it is a trusted file !
```

### Built With
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - The C/C++ IDE used
