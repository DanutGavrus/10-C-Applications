# Depth First Search
This project implements correctly and efficiently:
```
-"The "Depth First Search(DFS) graph algorithm".
```
WHEN RUN, a small demo appears (visual representation of the demo graph can be found in the file "Initial Graph For Demo.png") showing the programming technique and data structure used. Then a .html file is created containing graphs showing the differences as the number of vertices and edges change.<br/>
For the first test we set |V| = 100 and vary |E| between 1000 and 5000, using a 100 increment. For the second test we set |E| = 9000 and vary |V| between 100 and 200, using an increment equal to 10.

## Generated Graphs
YOU SHOULD GENERATE the graphs file by running the .exe file which does what is described above as there may be more graphs than those seen in this photo.<br/>
OR YOU SHOULD DOWNLOAD .rar archive containig the .html file with the graphs for this project.

## Getting Started
You can find a .exe version of the project for EASY TESTING. Also, this project's code can be found in the .cpp file.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION !
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on 9. Depth First Search.exe
```
If that does not work, create a new C/C++ project containing the .cpp file and add the .h file as a header, then run it.

### Warning !
```
! You might get a warning because the .exe file was not certificated, but it is a trusted file !
```

### Built With
