# Depth First Search
This project implements correctly and efficiently:
```
-"The "Depth First Search(DFS) graph algorithm".
```
When run, a small demo appears (visual representation of the demo graph can be found in the file "Initial Graph For Demo.png") and then a .html file is created containing graphs showing the differences as the number of vertices and edges change.<br/>
For the first test we set |V| = 100 and vary |E| between 1000 and 5000, using a 100 increment. For the second test we set |E| = 9000 and vary |V| between 100 and 200, using an increment equal to 10.

## Getting Started
You can find a .exe version of the project for EASY TESTING. Also, this project's code can be found in the .cpp file.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION !
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on 9. Depth First Search.exe
```
If that does not work, create a new C/C++ project containing the .cpp file and add the .h file as a header, then run it.

### Warning !
```
! You might get a warning because the .exe file was not certificated, but it is a trusted file !
```
