# Programming Techniques and Data Structures Implemented:
For these projects the following programming techniques and data structures were implemented correctly and efficiently:
```
-Heap Bottom-Up;
-Heap Top Down;
-QuickSort;
-QuickSelect;
-Bubble Sort;
-Insertion Sort;
-Binary Insertion Sort;
-Selection Sort;
-Order Statistics Tree;
-Binary Search Tree;
-Disjoint Sets
-The Kruskal Algorithm;
-Merge K Lists;
-Hash Tables;
-Depth First Search(DFS);
-Breadth First Search(BFS).
```
WHEN RUN, for each project, a small demo appears showing the programming technique and data structure used. Then a .html file is created containing graphs showing the differences between methods by tracking the number of assignments and comparisons each one does.<br/>
As input, each project receives arrays of dimensions between 100 and 10.000 one after the other. The increment is 100 and the arrays are filled with random values.

## Generated Graphs
YOU SHOULD RUN the .exe file, for each project, in order to generate the graphs by yourself and to see the demo.<br/>
ALSO, YOU CAN DOWNLOAD, for each project, the .rar archive containig a .html file with the graphs in order to see them bigger and clearer.

9. Breadth First Search
No graphs were generated for this project, but you should run it and see the demo.

## Getting Started
For each project you can find .exe version of it for EASY TESTING. Also, each has his own README and code can be found in the .cpp file.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION ! For each project:
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on "Application Name".exe
```
If that does not work, a new project must be created containing the .cpp file, and add the .h file as a header, then run.

### Warning !
```
! You might get a warning because .exe files were not certificated, but those are trusted files !
```

### Applications Were Built With
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - The C/C++ IDE used
