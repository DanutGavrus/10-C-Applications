# Programming Techniques and Data Structures Implemented:
For these projects the following programming techniques and data structures were implemented correctly and efficiently:
```
-Heap Bottom-Up;
-Heap Top Down;
-QuickSort;
-QuickSelect;
-Bubble Sort;
-Insertion Sort;
-Binary Insertion Sort;
-Selection Sort;
-Order Statistics Tree;
-Binary Search Tree;
-Disjoint Sets
-The Kruskal Algorithm;
-Merge K Lists;
-Hash Tables;
-Depth First Search(DFS);
-Breadth First Search(BFS).
```
WHEN RUN, for each project, a small demo appears showing the programming technique and data structure used. Then a .html file is created containing graphs showing the differences between methods by tracking the number of assignments and comparisons each one does.<br/>
As input, each project receives arrays of dimensions between 100 and 10.000 one after the other. The increment is 100 and the arrays are filled with random values.

## Generated Graphs
YOU SHOULD GENERATE the graphs file by running the .exe file which does what is described above as there may be more graphs than those seen in this photo.<br/>
OR YOU SHOULD DOWNLOAD .rar archive containig the .html file with the graphs for each project.

## Getting Started
For each project you can find .exe version of it for EASY TESTING. Also, each has his own README and code can be found in the .cpp file.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION ! For each project:
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on "Application Name".exe
```
If that does not work, a new project must be created containing the .cpp file, and add the .h file as a header, then run.

### Warning !
```
! You might get a warning because .exe files were not certificated, but those are trusted files !
```

### Applications Were Built With
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - The C/C++ IDE used
