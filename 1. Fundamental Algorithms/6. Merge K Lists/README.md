# Merge K Lists
This project implements correctly and efficiently:
```
-"An O(n log k) method for merging k sorted sequences";
-"Heap Structure Adapted".
```
When run, a small demo appears and then a .html file is created containing graphs showing the differences between methods by tracking the number of assignments and comparisons each one does.<br/>
As input, each method receives arrays of dimensions between 100 and 1000 one after the other. The increment is 100 and the arrays are filled with random values.

## Getting Started
You can find a .exe version of the project for EASY TESTING. Also, this project's code can be found in the .cpp file.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION !
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on 6. Merge K Lists.exe
```
If that does not work, create a new C/C++ project containing the .cpp file and add the .h file as a header, then run it.

### Warning !
```
! You might get a warning because the .exe file was not certificated, but it is a trusted file !
```
