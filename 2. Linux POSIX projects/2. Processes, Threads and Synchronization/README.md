# Processes, Threads and Synchronization
This project is made in Linux using POSIX and implements the following as described in the .pdf file:
```
-Create a Process Hierarchy(Chapter 2.2);
-Synchronizing threads from the same process(Chapter 2.3);
-Create a Threads Barrier(Chapter 2.4);
-Synchronizing threads from different processes(Chapter 2.5).
```

## Getting Started
You can find this project's description in Chapter1 and the requirements in Chapter2. Also, you should take a quick look over the code written in the .c file.<br/>
In order to test this project you need to:
```
1) Download .c and tester.py files in the same directory;
2) Open a new terminal in that directory and write: "gcc -Wall '2. Processes, Threads and Synchronization.c' -o '2. Processes, Threads and Synchronization'" (Chapter 2.1);
3) In order to test it write: "python tester.py" (Chapter 3.1);
4) If you want more details while testing, open tester.py and change verbose to true before step3.
```
When submitted, our implementation was tested with one more python file. Below I attached a photo with that testing result(which is a little lower compared to this tester's score of xx/100).
