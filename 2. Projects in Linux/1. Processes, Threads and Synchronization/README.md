# Processes, Threads and Synchronization
This project is made in Linux and implements the following:
```
-Processes;
-Threads;
-Synchronization.
```

## Getting Started
Unfortunately, this project is not easy to test anymore, but you can see every required task detailed in the .pdf file and you can throw an eye over the .c file containig the code. 
```
Every project had a file called "tester.py" which was executed in the linux terminal: "python tester.py". It was testing the implementation with a lot of different input values.
```

When submitted, our implementation was tested with one more python file. Below I attached a photo with the testing result.
