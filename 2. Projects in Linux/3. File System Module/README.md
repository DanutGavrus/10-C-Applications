# File System Module
This project is made in Linux and implements the following:
```
-Listing directory contents;
-Identifying and parsing section files;
-Working with sections;
-Sections filtering.
```

## Getting Started
Unfortunately, this project is not easy to test anymore. Unfortunately again, every student had slightly different tasks and I lost my tasks.pdf file, but, I uploaded one which is very similar. You sho see every required task detailed there and you shoul throw an eye over the .c file containig the code as it is nice written. 
```
Every project had a file called "tester.py" which was executed in the Linux terminal: "python tester.py". It was testing the implementation with a lot of different input values.
```

When submitted, our implementation was tested with one more python file. Below I attached a photo with the testing result.
