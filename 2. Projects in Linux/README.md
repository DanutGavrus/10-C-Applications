# Projects in Linux
These projects were made in Linux and implement the following:
```
-Forks;
-Semaphores;
-Threads Initialization and Termination;
-Synchronization;
-Pipes;
-Map Files;
-Shared Memory(SHM);
-Listing directory contents;
-Identifying and parsing section files;
-Working with sections;
-Sections filtering.
```

## Getting Started
Unfortunately, these projects are not easy to test anymore, but you can see every required task detailed in the .pdf file and you should throw an eye over the .c file containing the code as they are nice written, especially projects 2 and 3. 
```
Every project had a file called "tester.py" which was executed in the Linux terminal: "python tester.py". Those were testing the implementations with a lot of different input values.
```
</br>
When submitted, our implementations were tested with one more python file. Below I attached a photo with the testing results.
