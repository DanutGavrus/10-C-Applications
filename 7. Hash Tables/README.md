# Hash Tables
This project implements correctly and efficiently:
```
-"The "insert" and "search" operations in a hash table";
-""Open Addressing" and "Quadratic Probing"".
```
WHEN RUN, a small demo appears and then a table is created. A hashtable with the size of 10.007 is created for each test. For 5 different filling factors the "search" operation is evaluated.

## Generated Graphs
YOU SHOULD RUN the .exe file in order to see the demo.<br/>
No graphs were generated for this project.<br/>
But here is the table generated based on te evaluation described above.

## Getting Started
You can find a .exe version of the project for EASY TESTING. Also, this project's code can be found in the .cpp file.

### Installing
NO NEED FOR INSTALLATION !
Just open .exe file:
```
Double click on 7. Hash Tables.exe
```
If that does not work, create a new C/C++ project containing the .cpp file and add the .h file as a header, then run it.

### Warning !
```
! You might get a warning because the .exe file was not certificated, but it is a trusted file !
```
