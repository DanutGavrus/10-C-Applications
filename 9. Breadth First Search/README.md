# Breadth First Search
This project implements correctly and efficiently:
```
-"The "Breadth First Search(BFS) graph algorithm".
```
When run, a generous demo appears showing the steps of the BFS algorithm. Visual representation of the graph can be found in the file "Initial Graph For Demo.png".

## Generated Graphs
YOU SHOULD RUN the .exe file in order to see the demo.<br/>
No graphs were generated for this project.

## Getting Started
You can find a .exe version of the project for EASY TESTING. Also, this project's code can be found in the .cpp file.
