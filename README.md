# Programming Techniques and Data Structures Implemented:
For these projects the following programming techniques and data structures were implemented correctly and efficiently:
```
-Heap Bottom-Up.
-Heap Top Down.
-QuickSort.
-QuickSelect.
-Bubble Sort.
-Insertion Sort.
-Binary Insertion Sort.
-Selection Sort.
-Order Statistics Tree.
-Binary Search Tree.
-Disjoint Sets.
-The Kruskal Algorithm.
-Merge K Lists.
-Hash Tables.
-Depth First Search(DFS).
-Breadth First Search(BFS).
```
* Each project shows a small demo when run showing the programming technique and data structure used. Then a .html file is created containing graphs showing the differences between methods by tracking the number of assignments and comparisons each one does.  
* As input, each project receives arrays of dimensions between 100 and 10.000 one after the other. The increment is 100 and the arrays are filled with random values.
